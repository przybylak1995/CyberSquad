        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Kristof, known online as Nox Venator, and I'm passionate about cybersecurity with a strong focus on application security. After finishing my studies in Software Engineering at PXL, I've honed my skills through intense training on platforms like HackTheBox, tryhackme, and PortSwigger Labs. To solidify my expertise, I've achieved the Practical Web Tester certification from TCM Security.

            Beyond my technical skills, I'm committed to sharing my knowledge. I run a YouTube channel and community focused on bug bounty hunting. Through this platform, I empower individuals and organizations to enhance their cyber resilience. My own bug bounty hunting experiences have allowed me to help numerous companies identify and address vulnerabilities.
            
            Through my business, I aim to continue my mission of assisting others. By leveraging my deep understanding of application security, I strive to provide valuable insights and services to businesses seeking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.</p>

All hacking activities will be performed manually, no automated scanners will be used against your website. I'm a true hands-on hacker. This is my style. I love the thrill of finding vulnerabilities the old-fashioned way.</p>
